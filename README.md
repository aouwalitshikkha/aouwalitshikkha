### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Abdul Aouwal, and I am an SEO professional and digital marketing consultant. I have a passion for programming and code, and I am currently working with machine learning, Django, and the Django Rest Framework. I love making connections between programming and SEO, and I enjoy discovering new ways to improve my skills in both areas. In my free time, I enjoy spending time with my family and friends, and I am always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow.
